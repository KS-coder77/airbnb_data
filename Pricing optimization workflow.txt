Pricing optimization for Airbnb listings involves identifying the best price point that maximizes revenue and occupancy while staying competitive. Here's how you can approach pricing optimization using the dataset provided:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Current Pricing Trends**
- **Calculate Summary Statistics for Prices**:
  ```python
  df['price'].describe()
  ```
  - Insights: Determine the range, mean, median, and variability of prices.

- **Visualize Price Distributions**:
  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  sns.boxplot(x='neighbourhood_group', y='price', data=df)
  plt.title("Price Distribution by Neighbourhood Group")
  plt.show()
  ```
  - Insights: Identify outliers and understand price ranges across different boroughs.

- **Room Type Analysis**:
  ```python
  df.groupby('room_type')['price'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
  ```
  - Insights: Understand which room types (e.g., Entire home/apt) fetch higher prices.

---

### **Step 2: Incorporate Location as a Key Factor**
- **Group Prices by Neighborhood and Room Type**:
  ```python
  neighborhood_prices = df.groupby(['neighbourhood', 'room_type'])['price'].median()
  print(neighborhood_prices)
  ```
  - Insights: Determine the optimal price for each neighborhood-room type combination.

- **Proximity Analysis** (if relevant):
  - Use `latitude` and `longitude` to assess proximity to major attractions or transportation hubs.
  - Insights: Properties closer to high-demand areas can justify higher pricing.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Supply and Demand**
- **Occupancy Proxy**:
  ```python
  df.groupby(['neighbourhood', 'room_type'])['availability_365'].mean()
  ```
  - Insights: High availability may indicate low demand, while low availability suggests a need to adjust prices upward.

- **Reviews as a Demand Indicator**:
  ```python
  df.groupby(['neighbourhood', 'room_type'])['reviews_per_month'].mean()
  ```
  - Insights: Higher reviews per month suggest higher demand.

---

### **Step 4: Account for Competitor Pricing**
- **Identify Nearby Listings**:
  Use `latitude` and `longitude` to cluster listings into geographic zones:
  ```python
  from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

  coords = df[['latitude', 'longitude']]
  kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10, random_state=42)
  df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(coords)
  ```

- **Compare Prices Within Clusters**:
  ```python
  cluster_prices = df.groupby(['cluster', 'room_type'])['price'].mean()
  print(cluster_prices)
  ```
  - Insights: Benchmark prices against competitors in the same cluster.

---

### **Step 5: Create a Pricing Model**
- **Linear Regression for Price Prediction**:
  Use key variables to predict optimal prices:
  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

  # Prepare data
  features = df[['neighbourhood_group', 'room_type', 'minimum_nights', 
                 'calculated_host_listings_count', 'availability_365', 'reviews_per_month']]
  features = pd.get_dummies(features, drop_first=True)  # Encode categorical variables
  target = df['price']

  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

  # Train model
  model = LinearRegression()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # Evaluate
  print("Model R^2:", model.score(X_test, y_test))
  ```
  - Insights: Identify the most influential factors on pricing and suggest optimized prices.

- **Advanced Models**:
  Use decision trees, random forests, or XGBoost for more complex relationships.

---

### **Step 6: Adjust for Seasonal and Temporal Trends**
- **Analyze Seasonality**:
  Use `last_review` and `reviews_per_month` to identify high-demand months:
  ```python
  df['month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['last_review']).dt.month
  monthly_reviews = df.groupby('month')['reviews_per_month'].mean()
  monthly_reviews.plot(kind='bar')
  plt.title("Monthly Reviews Trend")
  plt.show()
  ```

- **Dynamic Pricing Suggestions**:
  Adjust prices upward during peak months or reduce them during low-demand periods.

---

### **Step 7: Revenue Optimization**
- **Estimated Annual Revenue per Listing**:
  ```python
  df['estimated_revenue'] = df['price'] * df['reviews_per_month'] * 12
  top_revenue = df.sort_values(by='estimated_revenue', ascending=False)
  print(top_revenue[['name', 'neighbourhood', 'price', 'estimated_revenue']].head(10))
  ```
  - Insights: Identify top-performing listings and emulate their pricing strategies.

---

### **Step 8: Evaluate Results**
- Monitor KPIs such as:
  - Occupancy rate (proxy: `availability_365` changes).
  - Revenue per listing (`estimated_revenue`).
  - Demand signals (`reviews_per_month` trends).

---

### Summary Workflow:
1. Analyze price distributions and key pricing factors (neighborhood, room type, availability).
2. Benchmark against competitors using clustering.
3. Build predictive models to suggest optimized prices.
4. Adjust prices dynamically based on seasonality or demand shifts.
5. Monitor KPIs to validate the effectiveness of price adjustments.
